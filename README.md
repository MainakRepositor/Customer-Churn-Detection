### Problem : 
What is churn prediction?

Churn prediction is predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving your company or canceling a subscription to a service, based on their behavior with your product.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to detect whether a person will turn out to be loyal or not by analysing the values of several features using the Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Tree.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
